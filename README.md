# CreditCardFraudDetection

📖 Overview

This project is part of my Codsoft internship and focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze transaction data and develop a model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

🚀 Features
* Analyze and preprocess transaction datasets.
* Explore patterns and anomalies in the data.
* Build and evaluate a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions.
* Provide insights into key indicators of fraudulent activities.
  
🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python: Programming language.
* Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning model development.
* Imbalanced-learn: Handle class imbalance in the dataset.

🧠 Steps Involved
* Data Analysis: Understand and visualize transaction trends and anomalies.
* Feature Engineering: Preprocess data and handle class imbalance.
* Model Building: Use classification algorithms to detect fraud.
* Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

🌟 Key Learnings
* Handling imbalanced datasets effectively.
* Identifying key indicators of fraudulent transactions.
* Applying classification techniques to solve real-world problems.
